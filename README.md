# UART_printf_VPC
Printf in the debugging process and retarget the printf to UART communication 


This code shows :

-How to transmit information with printf and UART communication to the PC (use Realterm console).

-How to retarget printf to UART in STM32CUBEIDE

-How to transmit float variables.

We use tge STM32 nucleo f401re with ST-LINKV2 DEBBUGGER/PROGGRANNER
